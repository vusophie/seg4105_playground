## Task

Summarize the following chapter on bets.


## Bets, Not Backlogs

### A few potential bets

- Betting tables instead of backlog
- Stakeholders look at pitches from previous 6 weeks
- All pitches are well-shaped, risk-reduced options
- If decide to bet on pitch, it goes into next cycle; else, let the pitch go

### Decentralized lists

- No single backlog
- Instead, keep list of requests or issues based on team (support, product, programmers, etc)
- 1-1s between departments to discuss relevant issues they are seeing

# The Betting Table

### Six-week cycles

- Cycle gives standard project size for shaping + scheduling
- Sprints = 2-week cycles (too short to make meaningful work + creating sprint plan)
- If deadline is too distant then team doesn’t use time efficiently until deadline creeps in
- Six weeks = golden number

### Cool-down

- 2-week cool-down period with no scheduled work to consider what to do next
- Programmers + designers can do whatever they want

### Team + project sizes

- Standard = 1 QA + (1 designer + 2 programmers / 1 designers + 1 programmer)
- Big batch = spends cycle on 1 project
- Small batch = spends cycle on 2+ projects (uses sprints)

### The betting tables

- Meeting during cool-down to decide what to do next
- Output = cycle plan (who is available, what are the business priorities, etc) for decision-making process
- C-suite / top lvl management take control of direction of cycle

### Meaning of a bet

- Payout = intentionally shaping work into 6-weeks
- Uninterrupted time = do not allow team to be interrupted / importance of momentum
- Circuit breaker = 1 project that is taking too long will freeze team / sign of bad shaping
- Bugs can wait 6+ weeks
    1. Use cool-down to discuss top bugs
    2. Bring it to betting table if cannot fix at cool-down
    3. Schedule a bug smash to pickup long-standing + important bugs
- We always shape what the end looks like for that cycle and that we keep our options open to change course.

# Place Your Bets

### Existing products vs new products

- Existing = standard Shape Up process
- New = process is over multiple cycles but only 1 bet

### R&D / research + development mode

1. Bet time on spiking some key pieces of new product idea  instead of pitch
2. Seniors make up team
3. No expectation to ship anything = spike instead of ship
4. Maybe UI + code but goal is to learn what works 
5. Decide cycle by cycle if we want to continue spending time in R&D

### Production mode

- Precedent set by R&D = new contributors to identify where new functionality belongs + how it fits into whole
1. Deliberate shaping
2. Multiple teams in parallel to cover more ground
3. Goal = shipping
4. Still experimental as long as expectations are set

### Cleanup mode

1. No shaping
2. Bug smash
3. Work is shipped/merged to main in small bites
4. Max 2 cycles

### Examples

1. In 2020, after two years of development, we launched a new email app and service called HEY. HEY was in `R&D mode` for the first year of its development. A team of three, Jason (CEO),  David (CTO), and Jonas (senior designer) explored a wide variety of ideas before settling on the core. Nearly a year of `production mode` cycles followed, where all of Basecamp’s teams fleshed out HEY’s feature set. We ended with two cycles of `cleanup` and significantly cut back the feature set to launch in July 2020.

2. When we built the Hill Charts feature in Basecamp, we had no idea if it was going to work out. We framed the project more like a production mode bet on a new product. We shaped a first version that was just functional enough to use ourselves. We didn’t expect to ship it to customers without doing an additional cycle on it. This was a risk: we bet one cycle, not two. If it didn’t work out, we’d scrap it. If something more important came up, we might not ever schedule the second cycle. But we ended up feeling confident after the first cycle.** We shaped a project to round it out, decided to bet another cycle, and then shipped it to customers.

### Betting table questions

1. Does the problem matter?
2. Is the appetite right?
3. Is the solution attractive?
4. Is this the right time?
5. Are the right people available?
