[Link to join our retro session (11/14/23)](https://www.figma.com/file/vjPnizS84xmUfNaIHasPhE/Sophie-%26-co%E2%80%99s-sprint-retro-(11%2F14%2F23)?type=whiteboard&node-id=14%3A357&t=WvbuyZ48vTAWz6HS-1)


### What tool will I use?
FigJam is a specialized retro tool with various tools and features to facilitate team discussions and feedback. 


### What format will I use?
Mad-Sad-Glad format will be used. Team members will express what made them mad, sad, and glad during the iteration. We will then explore emotions and perceptions to improve team dynamics.


### How will I make it engaging?
I will create a safe space. I will lead by example, show some vulnerability and open up myself with what I did wrong, or what I feel is a problem. I will emphasize that everyone must be treated with respect (no finger-pointing, no blaming, bullying, etc.). 


### How will I make it meaningful?
I will jot down some conversation topics or food for thought for the team to discuss. Out of what is being discussed, pick one and act on it - place it in the backlog as an action to change/implement something.
