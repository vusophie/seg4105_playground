## Notes from last week's betting table

### Identify the winning pitch
* Shopping cart feature
* Fundamental for our app because it affects the user's product selection and purchase. 


### Meeting notes on arriving at that decision
* Existing shopping cart is not user-friendly
* Design an easy-to-use cart for adding, viewing, and updating items. 


### Changes requested from the winning pitch
* We will keep the UI uniform with the rest of the platform. 
* To avoid potential distractions, we will focus on facilitatating user experiences and increasing sales.
