### Chapter 2 - Principles of Shaping

- Work shaping == balance between too vague and too concrete
- Going straight to wireframes limits creativity
- Insufficient context == uncontrollably + unclear boundaries
- Efficient shaping
    - Allows room for interpretation + creativity
    - Reduces risks by presenting a thorough solution
    - Sets boundaries + team efforts
- Main steps: setting boundaries, roughing out elements, addressing risks + rabbit holes, writing pitch

### Chapter 3 - Setting Boundaries

- Clear project boundaries = productive decision-making
- Value of idea = can determine appetite (time + resources allocated to idea) = prevents hasty commitment
- Importance of trade-offs between time + quality + scope
- Pain points shape the solution based off of needs

### Chapter 4 - Find the Elements

- Breadboarding helps design at an abstract level to represent interface components + interactions
- Fat marker sketches for visual concepts to avoid excessive details
- Checkboxes + affordances are used during shaping process to identify specific project elements
- Leave room for designers in early stages of the project to give space to creative decisions

### Chapter 5 - Risks + Rabbit Holes

- Shaping helps mitigate risks on project  budgets + timelines
- Thin-tailed probability distribution: deviations from schedule are minimal + predictable
- Fat-tailed probability distribution: unresolved technical + design challenges
- Identifying rabbit holes during shaping process helps address gaps + technical challenges + design problems
- Exclude certain use cases to keep project within time frame
- Exclude non-essential features (eg. remove color-coding)
