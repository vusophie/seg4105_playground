## Daily stand-up summary

Hi guys, the purpose of these meetings is to ensure that we’re all on the same page and tracking progress effectively. These meetings will be scheduled every kday from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. During these meetings, we’ll review our progress for the week, discuss any challenges encountered, and plan for the upcoming week. Fifteen minutes will be put aside every time to document our updates for the stakeholders.

On that note, I'll start off the stand-up meeting. 

I completed the initial UX research for the shopping cart feature. This involved a **competitive analysis** and **user testing** with 3 e-commerce websites: Sephora, Nike, and Forever 21. The focus was on their checkout processes. This marks the **uphill phase** of our project. The next step is to complete the prototypes and the wireframes of the shopping cart feature. I documented my findings in the [user_research_01](https://github.com/vusophie/seg4105_playground/tree/lab07/user_research_01.md) file you can find in the meeting notes. 

Thank you!
