## Task
* Read the scrum guide and write-up a 1-page summary focussing on the "daily stand up"
* Read "Show Progress" (Chapter 13) and write-up  1-page summary focussing on tasks you "the developer" will do to show your progress.

## 2020 Scrum guide summary (1 page == 500 words)
### Purpose of the Scrum guide
* Defines Scrum + its elements
* Emphasis on their importance for realizing value and results

### Scrum definition
* Lightweight framework for generating value through adaptive solutions to complex problems
* 1 PO, 1 Scrum Team, 1+ stakeholders work  iteratively in Sprints

### Scrum theory
* Grounded in empiricism +  lean thinking
* Optimizes predictability + controls risk through an iterative, incremental approach
* Scrum events facilitate inspection + adaptation
* Guided by transparency + inspection + adaptation pillars

### Scrum values
* Scrum teams has 5 values: 1) Commitment 2) Focus 3) Openness 4) Respect 5) Courage
* Guide decisions + actions + behavior + fostering trust + supporting the pillars of transparency +  inspection + adaptation

### Scrum team
* Scrum Team =  fundamental unit == Scrum Master + PO + devs
* Team = cross-functional + self-managing == accountable for all product-related activities + aiming to create a valuable Increment every Sprint

### Roles in Scrum
* Developers = plan Sprints + ensure quality + adapt plans daily toward the Sprint Goal
* PO = maximizes product value through effective Product Backlog management
* Scrum Master = Scrum adoption + coaches the team + removes impediments

### Scrum events
* Sprint event = work is turned into value + regular events
* Eg. Sprint Planning + Daily Scrum + Sprint Review + Sprint Retrospective
* Creating regularity + enabling transparency + minimizing unnecessary meetings

### Daily Scrum
* 15-minutes meeting for devs to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal + adjust the Sprint Backlog
* Enhances communication + identifies impediments + promotes quick decision-making

### Sprint review
* Inspects Sprint outcomes
* Determine future adaptations + collaborates on what to do next
* Working session + emphasizing discussion/adjustment
* Timeboxed to a maximum of 4 hours

### Sprint retro
* Plans to increase quality  by inspecting the previous Sprint
* Identifies helpful changes
* Addresses impactful improvements
* Maximum of 3 hours

### Scrum artifacs
* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Increment 
* Represent work/value + maximize transparency
* Each artifact has a commitment
* Product Goal + Sprint Goal + Definition of Done

## Chapter 13 - Show Progress summary (1 page == 500 words)
### Challenges with traditional status updates
* Managers avoid asking for status due to the awkwardness + potential nagging feel
* To-do lists == limitations in reflecting the true status, especially in terms of undiscovered tasks 

### Uncertainty in to-do lists
* To-dos !capture growth of tasks as the team makes progress
* Estimates attached to tasks may not accurately represent the uncertainty and complexity of the work. 

### Hill chart metaphor
* The hill chart metaphor divides work into uphill (figuring out) + downhill (execution) phases
* Visual representation of the project's status
* Nuanced understanding compared to to-do lists 

### Status without asking
* Basecamp introduces a feature to create hill charts == allows team members to intuitively update project status without the need for explicit status inquiries
* Managers can track changes over time + gain insights into what's in motion and what might be stuck 

### Addressing uncertainty / stuck points
* Uphill/downhill facilitates conversations about work progress rather than focusing on individuals

### Refractoring scopes for accuracy
* Stuck scope == indicate a problem in how it's defined rather than actual progress
* Breaking down scopes into smaller == independent movement + more accurate progress tracking 

### Building progress and sequencing work
* Teams == struggle if they prematurely consider a scope solved
* Hill chart == hands-on approach to problem-solving
* Pritizing the uphill phases of riskier + more critical scopes

### Effective sequencing using the Inverted Pyramid approach
* Effective teams prioritize critical + uncertain problems first
* Leave routine + less worrisome tasks for later
* "Inverted pyramid" concept == emphasis on addressing the most crucial aspects first

### Preventing backsliding + deciding when to stop
* Hill chart helps prevent backsliding
* Encourages hands-on approach to problem-solving√†
