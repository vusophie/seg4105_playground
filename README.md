## Task

Prepare to place your bets:
1. Find your team.
2. If 1-2 team members group up for the bet, make sure every team member has access to all pitches.
3. Schedule individual time (before the betting table) when each individual will review those pitches (~ 30 minutes per pitch).
4. Each individual will take notes (to be submitted with the deliverable).
5. Schedule 2 meetings inviting: (1) The Bet (first meeting to pick the winner); the team should spend ~ 20 minutes per pitch and take notes (2) Kick off (second meeting) to confirm all changes requested from the bet are done and "kick-off" the project.
