## Summary

### What is a pitch?

* A pitch is a directional 800 words document = this is the idea that we are after (sometimes customer suggested)
* Team takes direction and makes it happen
* Speck = very detailed pitch
* Two buckets = 1. Overly specified speck; 2. One-line ticket
* Focus on budget; forget estimates

### Who writes these pitches?

* Anyone can pitch an idea (eg. designer pitches idea of how to change use of Basecamp) = throw ideas out / sharing idea
* Formalized pitch / shaping document (what is done next)
* Framing = step before pitching where you define business problem
* Pitch = attempt at solution
* Customers are good at telling you their problem
* Software is bad when too user-centric and does not constitute single solution
* Importance of spotting patterns
* Pitch references several customers and points to several solution
* Good shaper = finds pattern among several issues to find single solution
* People that work on solution need to have experience problem-solving (eg. understanding how to build software)

### Solution != execution

* Collaboration between developers and shapers
* When developers nderstand the problem, they are able to flex autonomy (trust + power to find solution)
* Even best pitch is just a direction

### Three pillars of employee satisfaction

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose

### Rabbit-holes + no-goes
* Rabbit-holes = traps (looks appealing but you get stuck forever)
* Eg. Adding incremental value to something that will not happen very often
* No-goes = what NOT to focus on
