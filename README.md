## Task

### Start mapping your scopes (chapter 12)

After reading Chapter 12 think about your own project and the decomposition into tasks and scopes
* Decompose your pitch into scopes (features)
* Consider 1 scope in more detail

### Map tasks to progress (chapter 13)

After reading Chapter 13 and considering the one-scope (feature)
* Decompose scope into tasks (or unanswered questions) that will help you complete the scope (feature)
* Imagine that task being complete (or that question being answered)
* Map those task completions to positions on the hill

### Decompose your pitch into scopes (features)

### Consider 1 scope in more detail

By focusing on creating a user-friendly interface, we can enhance the overall shopping experience for users on the art supply website, ultimately contributing to improved conversion rates and user satisfaction.

## Decompose scope into tasks (or unanswered questions) that will help you complete the scope (feature)

* Scope: User-Friendly Interface
* List of tasks
1. What tools and technologies will be used to create interactive prototypes?
2. How will user feedback be gathered and incorporated into the design during the prototyping process?
3. What color scheme and typography will best align with the website's branding and the art supply theme?
4. How will the color scheme and typography affect user perception and engagement?
5. Where should items, quantities, prices, and actions be placed for the most intuitive and user-friendly layout?
6. How can we ensure that the layout is adaptable to different devices and screen sizes?
7. What types of feedback and confirmation messages should be displayed to ensure users are informed and reassured?
8. How can we ensure that error messages are both visually distinct and user-friendly?
