# Initial user research

# What do we want to prove?

- Aesthetic-usability effect
    - Users are more likely to perceive aesthetically pleasing design as more usable.
    - Users are drawn to the allure of luxury so a website that isn’t organized and clean can look inferior.
- Gestalt theory
    - Simplicity and structure are important in visual perception.
    - A cluttered checkout page can be off-putting.
- Cognitive load
    - A disorganized UI creates feelings of uncertainty.
    - This can lead to cart abandonment. since too much information or complexity can overwhelm the user.
- Hick’s Law
    - Every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision.
    - We should always prioritize a clean UI so that users don’t have time to overthink their purchases.
- Progressive Disclosure
    - We should only give the necessary information upfront to avoid overwhelming the user and revealing more detailed or additional information as needed.
    - Features like suggested items and afterpay integration can be introduced later in the user flow, such as during the payment process.

# What factors are we considering?

- User behaviour
    - How users interact with the checkout page.
    - Eg. navigation patterns, the time they spend on each section, and any difficulties they encounter.
- Comparison Between Sites
    - What do users like / dislike about the checkout processes.
    - Insights into what works well + what needs improvement.
- Usability
    - Users’ overall experience
- Security
    - Checkout pages involve financial transactions == do users feel secure while providing their payment information?
- Suggestions
    - Encourage users to provide ideas for enhancing the checkout experience.

# What are the cases?

1. Sephora (quick view, centred pop up modal, thematic suggestions, points system, afterpay, free shipping opportunities)
2. Nike (straight forward, clean UI)
3. Forever 21 (quick view, side pop up modal, suggestions, one click purchases) 

# What is our hypothesis?

Nike will have the most popular case.
